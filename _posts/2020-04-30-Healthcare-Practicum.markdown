###### Project Sponsor: Martin's Point Health Care ("MPHC")

###### Team: David Ramsay, Jordan Myerowitz, Sally Akuffo, Erik Duisberg

###### Project Title: Capacity Utilization Analysis

*Background:* With about 100 medical providers offering medical services from seven locations in Maine and New Hampshire, one of MPHC's most pressing concerns is the utilization of its Provider assets. But measurement of intelligent, caring and sophisticated people is complicated and multidimensional.

*Research Question:* Can UNH help Martin's Point increase its capacity utilization and better balance its load of patients across its Providers?

*Scope:* The analysis accessed de-identified and encrypted appointment scheduling, appointment type, claims, provider availability, provider contract and provider booked hours tables.

*Methods:* Several iterations of the data were analyzed, with the final dataset comprising approximately 8 million records; EDA was accomplished in Python with flat files exported to excel for additional analysis and to Tableau for creation of a dashboard.

*Deliverables and Business Impact:* A flexible dashboard that measures capacity utilization and other related metrics, by Provider, by Provider Type, by Provider Category and Facility over monthly and yearly timeframes. After submitting initial dashboard and analysis for feedback, the team also delivered a benchmarking study of potential capacity utilization improvements that could be made by bringing below-average individual provider productivity levels up to the mean level (simple average). Potential productivity improvement was estimated to be 1 to 4 percent of total Provider booked hours, or approximately 1000 to 4000 Provider hours per year.

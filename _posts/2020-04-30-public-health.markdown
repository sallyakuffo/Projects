#### Project Sponsor: New Hampshire Environmental Public Health Tracking ("NH EPHT")

## Team: David Ramsay, Jordan Myerowitz, Sally Akuffo, Erik Duisberg

## Project Title: Regional Clustering Analysis

**Background:** EPHT has responsibility for tracking and maintaining both Social Determinants of Health ("SDoH") and Health Outcomes data throughout the State of New Hampshire in order to better serve the state's citizens and address environmental public health concerns. EPHT's Community Health Outlook reports were developed from scratch in R, and were geared toward providing consistent packages of information to specific communities in NH. With data available at this special resolution, EPHT sees Data Science – and leveraging interrelationships of data and statistics across Communities, Regions and Counties – as a next logical step to help inform their decision-making process with the information and data already available.

**Research Question:** Can UNH reconcile data across geographies, in a way that introduces new data science techniques to help facilitate health interventions now and in the future?

**Scope:** To evaluate spatial patterns of Health Outcomes as they relate to SDoH using data available via the Community and Region Health Outlooks and supplemental materials available on the NH WISDOM Data Portal. No confidential information was shared.

**Methods:** Our study used Exploratory Data Analysis ("EDA"), Principal Components ("PCA") and k-Means Clustering in Python to examine the SDoH and Outlooks scoped above, aggregate statistics for relevant geographies, reduce dimensionality of the dataset, explore clustering for various options and finally determine the best geographic unit of analysis. Results were then compiled into k = 5 clusters and these five Character clusters were described in terms of their statistical makeup and locations. Finally, flat files were created for export into Tableau for creation of a dashboard that will empower EPHT to view their compiled data at-will within the geographies discussed in the presentation.

**Deliverables and Business Impact:** Deliverables included a presentation illustrating that while Outcomes were not used to create Regional clusters, these Outcomes (such as low birth weights, certain Emergency Department visits, elevated child blood lead levels and life expectancies) were well-linked to clusters formed using the SDoH variables. We suggested to EPHT that managing health programs through these five Character clusters would contribute to a virtuous circle of NH public health improvement. In order to provide subsequent analysis opportunities to EPHT, the above Tableau dashboard was also created. Subsequent to the presentation, a package of files and descriptive material, including the Dashboard, will be presented to EPHT. This project was viewed as a pilot collaboration between EPHT and UNH Analytics & Data Science; based on the level of participation by constituents at EPHT, Bureau of Public Health Protection and Department of Health and Human Services, we were optimistic that the pilot would lead to future collaborations which was the long-term goal of this project.

Our clusters of New Hampshire regions are below.
